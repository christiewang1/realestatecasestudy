Providing innovative data cleansing solution and strategic insights regarding real estate case study

PROMPT:
Given years of real estate data, present an analysis detailing Net Capital Expenditure (capital expenses less tenant improvement monies received) within each Cluster for 2016 & 2017. ***Notice that the data comes from disjointed sources and will require joining multiple data sources to accurately represent the historical results

Address the following key questions:
1. How did each Cluster perform per Desk & per USF (usable square feet) in 2017 compared to 2016?
2. How do the Clusters compare to each other? 
3. Which markets in each Cluster are the cheapest and most expensive to build in?
